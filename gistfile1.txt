document.write("<p>HI! <BR> I know u're probably surprised that paragraph is in html. COOL EH? yeah im proud of myself as well.<BR> Ngl i dont really know what to say but here it goes i guess.<BR><BR> Obhielv, I'm in love with you. Okay?<BR> Anyways, you're a really.. crazy and weird guy uk :) but that's okay, i like that. Jadi ga boring uk, random things everyday. Talking about random, i still cant get used to ur random 'i love you' s. it's still weird everytime. <BR>I like how you care about those or things yang important to you. u still weird tho.  SOMETIMES, ur presence kindaaa light up my day. I said sometimes because kadang juga u irritate me :D (dw, cuman a day or maybe even half a day ko). <BR>HEHEH Jailin u is fun, sorry if sometimes i take things too far tho. Also don't worry bro, i think i consider myself loyal when it comes to ACTUAL relationship. So far i have no intention of cheating on u nor breaking up with u, and i'm not bored with u. Im also sorry that i dont think we can go on dates often because of uni things :( hhhh padahal we ldr soon. Do you remember dulu i pernah bilang that i would prolly cry because of u? Yeah so mostly kyknya gr gr i miss u while lg.. time of the month (pas ldr loh ya) :). I also look forward to do our inexplicably many date ideas. Just a simple watching movies with u udh enough jg sih buat i.. POKONYA UR PRESENCE ADA DEH. <BR> OKAY! Maybe it's time for the confessions. To be honest no matter how many times u say it, calling 'darling' will always gives me butterflies.... and possibly a heart attack (that's why please stop). AND HERE'S THE BIGGEST ONE... non of those nicknames, hit as hard as my own name. Yes, i prefer u calling me by name ngl. I dont know why dude... jantungan cube okay. But please, again, don't say it T^T sakit jantung saya bro. <BR><BR> p.s I really don't know whatelse to say man.. but i'm sorry, i still cant say everything yg in my head sometimes... i bener bener ga biasa uk.. I REALLY HOPE THAT ONE DAY I CAN TELL U EVERYTHING WITHOUT HESITATIONS. Well.. I;m still not used to ANY of this. I dont hate it tho, I LOVE IT. Every second of it, ur annoyingness, weirdness, love, care, EVERYTHING. Nanti pas ldr, don't forget to put urself first ya, jgn terlalu cape, jgn terlalu maksain... i kalo ada apa apa i bakal bilang ko ke u. Udh deh ya itu aja dulu for now. I LOVE YOU.<BR><BR> Full of love, <BR> Marvelouise</p>")
